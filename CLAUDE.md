# CLAUDE.md — rDPS Meter mod

Launch `claude` from this directory (`/home/sean/sts2-mod/RdpsMeter`) so the
right project-memory bucket and this file load. Deep context lives in memory
(`sts2_rdps_mod.md`, `wsl_dotnet.md`).

## Git

I manage the whole repo. **Commit AND push after each change** — no approval
needed for this repo (unlike the `ms` project). One logical change per commit,
step by step. Never force-push (the Claude Code classifier blocks it; the user
runs those via `! ...`).

**Never re-add `lib/sts2.dll`** — it's MegaCrit proprietary, gitignored, and
purged from history. `0Harmony.dll` / `GodotSharp.dll` stay tracked (MIT).

## Releasing a new version

Every release ships to **all three**: GitHub, Steam Workshop, and Nexus Mods.
Don't do only one — do all three, or say explicitly which is blocked and why.

1. Bump `version` in `RdpsMeter.json`; update the `changeNote` in
   `workshop/workshop.json`.
2. Commit + push to origin.
3. **Nexus** (I can run this): `./nexus/publish.sh` (dry-run first with
   `--dry-run`). Fully automatable from WSL — uploader action + API key are
   already installed.
4. **Steam**: `bash workshop/sync.sh` to re-stage, then tell the user to run
   `.\ModUploader.exe upload -w RdpsMeter` from Windows
   `C:\Users\Sean\sts2-workshop` (I can't run the Windows uploader).

## Text on screen

Every string the meter shows goes through `Loc.T` and lives in
`localization/<lang>.json` (compiled into the dll as embedded resources) — never
inline in the UI code. Chinese (`zhs`) is the language that matters most after
English. Run `tools/check-localization.sh` after touching a table. Any new
`Label` needs `Loc.ApplyFont(label, "font")`, or non-Latin text draws as boxes.

## Building

Set `DOTNET_ROOT=$HOME/.dotnet`, `DOTNET_SYSTEM_GLOBALIZATION_INVARIANT=1`, and
put `~/.dotnet` on PATH (`deploy.sh` / `package.sh` bake these in). Ship builds
are plain `-c Release` (harness compiled out); `-p:Harness=true` enables the
dev harness. Cross-version: run the binding verifier under `tools/` against each
captured `sts2.dll` before shipping.
